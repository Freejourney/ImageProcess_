# ImageProcess_Recognition

Here are codes to solve some problems about image process „ÄÅimage recognition and so on.
<<<<<<< HEAD


**Field_Of_View**: in order to extract the center object sign(a white bar), Hough Transform is applied in the codes, which can extract the circle enclosing our object sign. 

**Frames_Interval_Measure**: to measure the interval time between two frames in a video, I use image matching to achieve the function. It's obvious that it would cost massive time if I just use it to finish my purpose. So I extract feature to constrain image matching situation and it works not bad. 

**Zero_Move_Momentum**: be similar to Field_Of_View.
